# Data Science Project Boilerplate

This boilerplate is designed to kickstart data science projects by providing a basic setup for database connections, data processing, and machine learning model development. It includes a structured folder organization for your datasets and a set of pre-defined Python packages necessary for most data science tasks.

## Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`src/app.py`** → Main Python script where your project will run.
- **`src/explore.ipynb`** → Notebook for exploration and testing. Once exploration is complete, migrate the clean code to `app.py`.
- **`src/utils.py`** → Auxiliary functions, such as database connection.
- **`requirements.txt`** → List of required Python packages.
- **`models/`** → Will contain your SQLAlchemy model classes.
- **`data/`** → Stores datasets at different stages:
  - **`data/raw/`** → Raw data.
  - **`data/interim/`** → Temporarily transformed data.
  - **`data/processed/`** → Data ready for analysis.


## ⚡ Initial Setup in Codespaces (Recommended)



## 💻 Local Setup (Only if you can't use Codespaces)



**Create a database (if necessary)**



**Environment Variables**

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project to store your environment variables, such as your database connection string:
